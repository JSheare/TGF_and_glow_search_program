# Tgfsearch
## A package containing tools for searching data generated by the instruments of the terrestrial gamma-ray flash group at UCSC.
### To install the package, run the following pip command:

    pip install tgfsearch@git+https://github.com/JSheare/TGF_and_glow_search_program

# **Instructions for Search Program Use:**
The package's main tool is a program that searches data for TGFs and Glows. There are two ways to run the program: via
the GUI, and via the command line.

## **Using the GUI (Preferred):**
You can open the search program's graphical user interface by running the following command in the command line:

    tgf-search

To start a search, enter the first date in your search range in the entry box labeled 'Date One'. 

Next, enter the last date in your search range in the entry box labeled 'Date Two' (if you're searching a single day, 
you can leave this blank). 

Afterward, specify the instrument you want to search in the box labeled 'Detector'.

If you're running the program on Thrud (UCSC TGF group data computer) you're now ready to begin a search. Otherwise, 
you may need to specify an import location for the data. This can be done by entering the data directory in the box
labeled 'Import Location' or by clicking on the 'Browse' button to the right of the box and navigating to the data
directory. 

Finally, to begin a search, simply click the 'Start' button. Output from the search will now appear onscreen, and
search results will be stored in a folder called 'Results' located inside the directory specified in the 
'Export Location' entry box (present working directory by default).

The search can be stopped at any time by clicking the 'Stop' button, and text can be cleared from onscreen by
clicking 'Clear Text'. You can also reset the entered dates/detector/modes all at once by clicking the 'Reset' button.

### **Program Modes:**
The program has several 'modes' that give it enhanced functionality. To run the program with any of the modes, simply
check the mode's corresponding tick box. Details on what each mode does can be found below.

- **'onescint' Mode:** - This mode instructs the program to run the short event search algorithm on only the default
scintillator (typically the large plastic). This is generally a faster (though less thorough) search.


- **'allscints' Mode** - This mode tells the program to run the short event search algorithm on all the scintillators 
individually (by default the program combines all scintillator data into a single set).


- **'aircraft' Mode** - If the detector you're searching was deployed to an aircraft or some other high-altitude 
location during the search period, this is the mode that you want to use. It adds a special check to the short event 
search algorithm that filters out false alarms caused by cosmic rays, and uses a more fine-grained rolling baseline in
the long event search algorithm.

- **'clnenrg' Mode** - This mode cuts out all maximum energy counts (> 65000) and all very low energy counts (< 100)
when the data is being read. 

- **'pickle' Mode** - This mode serializes and saves imported data for later use OR imports previously-serialized data.

- **'skshort' Mode** - This mode skips the short event search algorithm.

- **'sktrace' Mode** - Thise mode skips the trace filtering algorithm.

- **'skglow' Mode** - This mode skips the long event search algorithm.

### **Enqueuing Multiple Searches:**
If desired, several searches can be enqueued and then executed sequentially.
To do this, simply fill out the search fields as described above and then press the 'Enqueue' button. 
Once you've added all of your desired searches to the queue, click 'Start' and the program will 
execute them all in the order in which they were entered.

To clear the queue without running any searches, click the 'Reset' button.

### **Adaptive Mode:**
If the data that you're trying to search is from an instrument with an arbitrary scintillator configuration and/or an 
instrument that the program doesn't explicitly support yet, you can instead opt to use an adaptive mode that
will dynamically infer the identity of the instrument based on the given data files. To use it, just enter the word
'adaptive' in the detector entry box and the directory containing the data in the import entry box.

Note: if the data is organized into daily folders, specify the directory that contains these folders.

## **Running the Program Through the Command Line:**

### **Single day:**
To search a single day only, enter a command of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector

where 'yy' corresponds to the year, 'mm' corresponds to the month, and 'dd' corresponds to the day.
<br/>
Here's an example for GODOT data on December 3rd, 2015:

    tgf-search-cl 151203 151203 GODOT

### **Date Range:**
To search a range of dates, follow the same instructions given for a single day, but replace the second 'yymmdd' 
with the last date in the desired range.
Here's an example for THOR5 data from July 1st, 2022 to August 31st, 2022:

    tgf-search-cl 220701 220831 THOR5

### **Program Modes:**
The program has several 'modes' that give it enhanced functionality. Here's a list of them all and how to use them:
<br/>
#### **'custom' Mode:**
This mode can be used to specify custom data import and result export locations. To use it, enter a command
of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector -c "import_directory" "export_directory"

Note: if you don't wish to specify one of the locations, simply use the word 'none' instead. Here's an example
where we omit a custom import location:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector -c none "export_directory"

#### **'onescint' Mode:**
This mode instructs the program to run the short event search algorithm on only the default scintillator (typically 
the large plastic). This is generally a faster (though less thorough) search.

To use the program in this mode, enter a command the same way as above but add the flag '--onescint' to the end:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --onescint

#### **'allscints' Mode:**
This mode tells the program to run the short event search algorithm on all the scintillators individually
(by default the program combines all scintillator data into a single set).

To run the program in this mode, enter a command the same way as above but add the flag '--allscints' to the end:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --allscints

#### **'aircraft' Mode:**
If the detector you're searching was deployed to an aircraft or some other high-altitude 
location during the search period, this is the mode that you want to use. It adds a special check to the short event 
search algorithm that filters out false alarms caused by cosmic rays, and uses a more fine-grained rolling baseline in
the long event search algorithm.

To run the program in this mode,enter a command the same way as above but add the flag '--aircraft' to the end:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --aircraft

#### **'clnenrg' Mode:**
This mode cuts out all maximum energy counts (> 65000) and all very low energy counts (< 100)
when the data is being read.

To use it, enter a command of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --clnenrg

#### **'pickle' Mode:**
This mode serializes and saves imported data for later use OR imports previously-serialized data.

To use it, enter a command of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --pickle

#### **'skshort' Mode:**
This mode skips the short event search algorithm.

To use it, enter a command of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --skshort

#### **'sktrace' Mode:**
This mode skips the trace filtering algorithm.

To use it, enter a command of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --sktrace

#### **'skglow' Mode:**
This mode skips the long event search algorithm.

To use it, enter a command of the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --skglow


#### **Many Modes:**
It is possible to use as many of these modes in tandem as the user needs 
<br/>
(i.e. commands like this are possible):

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd detector --pickle --allscints --aircraft

### **Adaptive Mode:**
If the data that you're trying to search is from an instrument with an arbitrary scintillator configuration and/or an 
instrument that the program doesn't explicitly support yet, you can instead opt to use an adaptive mode that
will dynamically infer the identity of the instrument based on the given data files. To use it, enter a command of 
the following form:

    tgf-search-cl yymmdd yymmdd adaptive -c "import_directory" "export_directory"

where import_directory is required and specifies the directory where the data is located. 

Note: if the data is organized into daily folders, specify the directory that contains these folders.

# **Using the Image Collector:**
The package also has a helpful utility for collecting the image files generated by the search program. To use it, enter
a command of the following form in the command line:

    tgf-collect yymmdd yymmdd detector

where the first 'yymmdd' is the first date in the desired collection range and the second 'yymmdd' is the last. 
Images will be copied from the "Results" directory to a new directory called "collected_images".

### **Specifying Custom Result and Image Collection Locations:**
By default, the image files are gathered from and collected in the present working directory, but if you'd like to use 
custom locations you can use the '-c' flag:

    tgf-collect yymmdd yymmdd detector -c "results_loc" "collection_loc"

Where "results_loc" is the location of the "Results" directory and "collection_loc" is the location where the new 
directory "collected_images" will be created.

Note: if you don't wish to specify one of the locations, simply use the word 'none' instead. Here's an example
where a custom collection location has been omitted:

    tgf-collect yymmdd yymmdd detector -c "results_loc" none


### **Including Only the Top-Ranked Short Events:**
To include only the top-ranked short events, you can use the '-tr' flag:

    tgf-collect yymmdd yymmdd detector -tr

By default, only events with a rank of one are included, but if you'd like to include events with ranks that are equal
to or higher than a particular value, you can do so by supplying the value as an argument. Here's an example where only 
events with rank 13 or higher are included:

    tgf-collect yymmdd yymmdd detector -tr 13


### **Including Only Short Events With A Minimum Score:**
To include only those short events which have a score greater than or equal to a certain value, you can use the '-ms'
flag. Here's an example where only events with a score at or above 0.5 are included:

    tgf-collect yymmdd yymmdd detector -ms 0.5


# **Using Data Tools:**
In addition to the search program and associated utilities, the package also includes data handling tools that you can 
use to build your own programs and scripts. This section will serve as an example for how to use many of these tools, 
with special emphasis placed on Detector objects, as they are the main focus of the package. 

To get started, import the package:
```python3
import numpy as np  # for parts of the example
import tgfsearch as tgf
```
Just to make sure we've covered all our bases, for those who are already familiar with the single-file data reader, it's
included in the package and can be used like so:
```python3
passtime = None
data, passtime = tgf.read_file('/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz', passtime)
# where data is just a dataframe like you're probably used to.
```

### **Using the Reader Class:**
The package also includes a convenient, object-oriented interface to the data reader through a class called Reader. To use it, 
create a reader instance like so:
```python3
reader = tgf.Reader()
```
To read data, use the read() method:
```python3
data = reader.read('/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz')
```
Where data is a pandas dataframe. No passtime required; it's kept internal, which can be particularly useful when 
reading several consecutive files.

If you need to, though, you can still get at passtime like this:
```python3
passtime = reader.passtime
```
And, if desired, you can also opt to reset passtime to default after reading a file:
```python3
data = reader.read('/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz', reset_after=True)
```
Or at an arbitrary time using the reset() method:
```python3
reader.reset()
```

### **Basic Detector Class Usage:**
Detector is a class that's designed to quickly and efficiently import and provide access to all data (list mode and 
trace) for a single day. Throughout these examples, we'll be using August 31st, 2022 on Thor 1 as a test day.

The best way to get a detector object of the correct type is to use the provided function get_detector():
```python3
detector = tgf.get_detector('THOR1', '220831')
```
If you're using the package on Thrud, you're already good to go. But in case you aren't, or you're trying to import data
from somewhere other than the main data drive, you can also set a custom import location:
```python3
detector.set_import_loc('/home/user/THOR1/220831')
```
Additionally, some of Detector's member functions are capable of exporting files for various purposes. By default, these
files are exported to your present working directory, but you can also specify a custom directory like so:
```python3
detector.set_results_loc('/home/user')
```
Now we're ready to import data, and we do so like this:
```python3
detector.import_data()
```
Note that this process can take several minutes depending on the size of the data set. By default, both list mode data 
and trace data are imported, but this can be changed using the two optional boolean parameters import_lm and 
import_traces.

The Detector will attempt to import any data it finds in its specified import directory. But, in case the data is 
missing or couldn't be imported properly, you can also check to see if it's present:
```python3
for scintillator in detector:
    if not detector.data_present_in(scintillator):  # Checking that list mode data is present (default)
        print(f'List mode data missing for {scintillator}.')

    if not detector.data_present_in(scintillator, data_type='trace'):  # Checking that trace data is present
        print(f'Trace data missing for {scintillator}.')
```

### **Getting and Setting Basic Information for Detector:**
The Detector class has several useful class attributes containing basic information that are worth knowing about:
```python3
unit = detector.unit  # The name of the instrument (string).
date_str = detector.date_str  # The date in yymmdd format (string).
full_date_str = detector.full_date_str  # The date in yyyy-mm-dd format (string).
first_sec = detector.first_sec  # The first second of the day in epoch time.
deployment = detector.deployment  # Deployment information for the instrument on the requested day (if available).
scint_list = detector.scint_list  # A list of abbreviations corresponding to the instrument's scintillators.
```
These are the most likely to be useful, but there are several others too. See the Detector documentation (linked at the 
bottom) for a full list.

If the information you're looking for is particular to a single scintillator, you can use the get_attribute() method:
```python3
eRC = detector.get_attribute('LP', 'eRC')  # Getting the serial number of the large plastic scintillator.
lm_filelist = detector.get_attribute('LP', 'lm_filelist')  # Getting a list of all large plastic list mode files.
trace_filelist = detector.get_attribute('LP', 'trace_filelist')  # Getting a list of all large plastic trace files.
lm_data = detector.get_attribute('LP', 'lm_frame')  # Getting all the large plastic list mode data for the whole day.
```
As above, these are the most common attributes, but you can request any on the following list:
- name - The scintillator's name (abbreviated).
- eRC - The scintillator's serial number.
- lm_frame - A pandas dataframe containing all the scintillator's list mode data.
- lm_files - A list of list mode files for the day.
- lm_file_ranges - A list of lists. Each sublist contains a pair of numbers corresponding to the first and last second
        in each list mode file.
- lm_file_indices - A dictionary of lists. Each list contains the indices needed to slice data for a particular file
        out of lm_frame.
- trace_filelist - A list of trace files for the day.
- traces - A dictionary containing trace data for each of the day's trace files.
- reader - The Reader object used to read the scintillator's data files.

Additionally, you can also assign new information to these attributes using the Detector's set_attribute() method:
```python3
# Setting the filelist for the large plastic scintillator to a single file.
detector.set_attribute('LP', 'lm_filelist',
                       ['/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz'])
```
Note that the new information must be of the same type as the old information or an error will be raised.

### **Getting and Setting List Mode Data Columns:**
Detector has a built-in method for getting individual columns of list mode data as numpy arrays.
```python3
time = detector.get_lm_data('LP', 'SecondsOfDay')  # Getting the large plastic SecondsOfDay column as a numpy array.
energy = detector.get_lm_data('LP', 'energy')  # Getting the large plastic energy column as a numpy array.
wc = detector.get_lm_data('LP', 'wc')  # Getting the large plastic wc (wallclock) column as a numpy array.
```
You can also request a column from only a single data file like so:
```python3
file_time = detector.get_lm_data('LP', 'SecondsOfDay', file_name='/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/'
                                                                 'eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz')
```
Finally, you can also set the data for a particular column using the set_lm_data() method:
```python3
detector.set_lm_data('LP', 'energy', np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # Example array
```
Note that the new data must be of the same length as the old data or an error will be raised.

### **Finding Matching List Mode Files and Trace Files:**
Detector contains two main member functions for matching count times with their corresponding list mode files or trace 
files. Say, for example, we have a large plastic count at 73000 seconds of day that we want to match:
```python3
# Matching the count to the name (as a string) of the list mode file it came from.
matching_lm_file = detector.find_lm_file('LP', 73000)

# Matching the count to a list of trace file names (strings) that it *could* have come from.
matching_traces = detector.find_matching_traces('LP', 73000)
```

### **Getting Specific Files' Data:**
Detector has two member functions for getting all data from specific files: one is for list mode files, the other is for
trace files. All you need to provide is the name of the scintillator the file is from and the name of the file itself:
```python3
lm_file_data = detector.get_lm_file('LP', '/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/'
                                          'eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz')

trace_file_data = detector.get_trace('LP', '/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/'
                                           'eRC4195lpl_xtr_220831_191800.xtr.gz')
# These functions return dataframes.
```

### **Pickling and Unpickling Detectors:**
A Detector object can be pickled (saved to a file, data and all) and unpickled using the following functions:
```python3
# Pickling our detector object in a file named "my_detector.pickle" to a results folder in the directory "/home/user"
# Note that path is an optional variable, and if left unspecified the detector will be pickled to its results directory.
pickle_path = tgf.pickle_detector(detector, 'my_detector', path='/home/user')

detector = tgf.unpickle_detector(pickle_path)
```
These functions can be useful if you're using the same data set over and over again and want to avoid the lengthy
import procedure.

### **Splicing Two Detectors Together:**
Data from two different Detectors can be combined using the splice() method, yielding a new Detector with
a combination of both datasets:
```python3
# Making another Detector for the purpose of the example
detector2 = tgf.get_detector('THOR1', '220830')
detector2.set_import_loc('/home/user/THOR1/220830')
detector2.import_data()

# Calling the splice() method returns a new Detector
detector3 = detector1.splice(detector2)

# If you want, you can also use the normal addition syntax to do a splice
# detector3 = detector + detector2

# or += to overwrite an existing detector with the new, spliced one
# detector += detector2
```
The new Detector (detector3) will contain the seamlessly-combined data from both detector1 and detector2.
There are a few things to note about the new Detector:
- It will use the *earlier* of the two Detectors' dates as its own. For example, because detector has the date
      220831, and detector2 has the date 220830, detector3 will use the earlier 220830.
- Time data in the new Detector will be updated to reflect the difference in date between the two provided
      Detectors. For example, detector and detector2 are separated by a day, so all the data from the later
      Detector (detector2 in this case) will be corrected one day forward.
- Trying to import data with the new Detector won't work and will instead raise an error.

If you ever need to get a list of dates stored in a Detector, you can do so with Detector's dates_stored attribute:
```python3
dates_stored = detector3.dates_stored  # In this example, the list would be ['220830', '220831']
```


### **Clearing Data from Detector:**
Detector also has a method for clearing all currently stored data:
```python3
detector.clear()
```
Additionally, you can also opt to clear all stored data BUT leave file lists alone:
```python3
detector.clear(clear_filelists=False)
```

### **Detector Methods and Deep Copying:**
To make sure that data can't be modified by accident, several of Detector's getter and setter functions return/make deep
copies of the resource being requested/assigned. This behavior can be overridden using the optional boolean parameter 
'deepcopy' for the following member functions:
- get_attribute()
- set_attribute()
- get_lm_file()
- get_trace()

For example, the following code will return the actual list mode file dataframe stored in Detector rather than a copy:
```python3
actual_lm_data = detector.get_lm_file('LP', '/media/tgfdata/Detectors/THOR/THOR1/220831/'
                                            'eRC4195lpl_lm_220831_235435.txt.gz', deepcopy=False)
```
This can be performant in some cases, but be careful not to modify your data by accident!


### **Adaptive Detector:**
For maximum flexibility, the package contains a special child class of Detector called AdaptiveDetector that can be used
to handle data from instruments with arbitrary scintillator configurations. You can get one like so:

```python3
adaptive = tgf.get_detector('ADAPTIVE', '220831')
```

You can use AdaptiveDetector in essentially the exact same way as Detector, with a few important caveats:
- You *must* supply an import directory before you can import data. AdaptiveDetector infers its identity based on the
  data files found in the import directory, so you *have* to give it a populated import directory before anything else 
  can proceed. Trying to import data without doing this will result in an error.
- Specifying an import directory will clear all currently stored data and the current identity before inferring a new 
  identity. This is to prevent the object from ending up in a hybrid state with multiple identities. Be wary of this 
  when changing the import directory.
- AdaptiveDetector's identity inference *might* be wrong. When this happens, the object may behave in unexpected ways.
  So, use it at your own risk.

You can check whether any Detector (and, by inheritance, any AdaptiveDetector) has an identity using
the has_identity() method:

```python3
if adaptive.has_identity():
    print(f'adaptive has identity and is named {adaptive.unit}')
```


### **Trace Filtering and Alignment:**
The package contains several functions for filtering and aligning traces that you may find useful.

```python3
# For single traces. is_good will be True if the trace is good.
is_good = tgf.is_good_trace(trace_file_data)

# For a group of traces stored in a Detector. The result will be a list containing the names of traces that are
# likely to be interesting for the requested scintillator (the large plastic in this example).
good_trace_names = tgf.filter_traces(detector, 'LP')

if is_good:
    # Aligning the trace with its corresponding list mode data. This will return two numpy arrays: one with the
    # correctly-aligned times and another with the magnitude-corrected trace energies.
    trace_times, trace_energies = tgf.align_trace(trace_file_data, lm_file_data)
```
